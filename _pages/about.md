👋 Hello and welcome!  
I’m **Arnab Roy**, a graduate student researcher working with interested in the physics of living systems. My work focuses on understanding how **mechanics, geometry, and active processes** drive organization and pattern formation in biological and bio-inspired systems.

Broadly, my research interests include:

- Active matter and soft condensed matter  
- Fluid mechanics in biological contexts  
- Nonlinear dynamics and pattern formation  
- Biophysics of cytoskeletal systems  

I am currently pursuing my **PhD in Physics at UC Merced**, where I work with **[your advisor – optional]** in studying emergent behavior in complex active systems.

Before this, I completed my **[BSc/MSc or previous degree]** at **[your previous institution]**, working on **[briefly describe your earlier work]**.

Beyond science, I enjoy **[your hobbies]**, exploring creative ideas, and learning new skills.

Thanks for stopping by — feel free to explore my publications and projects!
